## About

I'm [Michelle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-blanchette/), a full-stack WordPress developer professionally known as [Purple Turtle Creative](https://purpleturtlecreative.com/).

In my spare time, I enjoy working on WordPress projects of my own! Sometimes I share my projects and make them available for free download so others can use them. That is why I've created this documentation website.

My favorite words are "efficient", "productive", and "simple".

## Support

Since I need to make a living, paid client work takes priority which means I'm unable to guarantee support for my free software. However, please do feel free to [email me](mailto:michelle@purpleturtlecreative.com) if you have any questions or suggestions! I'm often quick to respond.

Additionally, you can [follow my software adventures on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/purple-turtle-creative). I only post major announcements and new blog posts, so it surely won't impose on your feed.

If you have a major request or need custom WordPress development, please [hire me](https://purpleturtlecreative.com/#contact)!
