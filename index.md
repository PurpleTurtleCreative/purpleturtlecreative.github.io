## About

I'm Michelle, a full-stack WordPress developer. In my spare time, I enjoy working on WordPress projects of my own. Sometimes, I share my projects and make them available for download for others to use. That is why I've created this documentation website.

My favorite words are "clean", "simple", and "efficient".

## Support

Since I'm employed full-time and often working on projects, I'm unable to guarantee support for my softwares. However, please do feel free to [email me](mailto:michelle@purpleturtlecreative.com) if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm often quick to respond.

Additionally, you can [follow my software adventures on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/purple-turtle-creative). I only post major announcements and new blog posts, so it surely won't impose on your feed.
