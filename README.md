## About

I'm Michelle, a full-stack WordPress developer. In my spare time, I enjoy working on a few WordPress plugins of my own! I believe in quality over quantity. For that reason, I prefer finely crafting a few plugins rather than maintaining a plethora of mediocre projects.

My favorite words are "clean", "simple", and "efficient".

## Support

Since I'm employed full-time and obsessed with web development, I'm unable to guarantee providing support for my softwares. However, please do feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/PurpleTurtleCreative/purpleturtlecreative.github.io/discussions) if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm often quick to respond and would love to hear your thoughts!

Additionally, you can [follow my software adventures on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/purple-turtle-creative). I only post major announcements and share my new blog posts, so it surely won't impose on your feed!

## Contributions

Did you notice any mistakes while reading through the docs? Well, that's embarrassing. Good catch, though! Please contribute a correction or suggestion by editing any article on GitHub. At the bottom of every doc, there is a handy link to [*"Edit this page on GitHub"*](https://github.com/PurpleTurtleCreative/purpleturtlecreative.github.io/edit/main/README.md).

Even when these docs are flawless, though, I bet you still have some interesting ideas to share! You can participate in general discussions, ask questions, or share feature suggestions in the Purple Turtle Creative forum. All I ask is that you refrain from soliciting work opportunities. Let's keep threads on topic!
