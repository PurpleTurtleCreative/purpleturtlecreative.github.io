**Welcome to the new documentation website.** It's nice to see you here! :tada:

I'm glad you're wanting to learn more about Completionist. Big changes came with the recent release of **v2.0.0**, so a lot of the original documentation became irrelevant and outdated.

Since I needed to rewrite much of the documentation anyways, why not freshen up with a shiny new site? :sparkles:

The best part is that this site's articles are hosted on GitHub. This means we can easily collaborate together. Go team! You can [learn more about making contributions](https://docs.purpleturtlecreative.com/#contributions) and participating in discussions on [the Purple Turtle Creative Docs homepage](https://docs.purpleturtlecreative.com/).

I hope to hear from you soon! I'll be here in the meantime, documenting all of Completionist's great features. :pencil2:
